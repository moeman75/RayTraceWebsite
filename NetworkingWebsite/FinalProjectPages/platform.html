The project will utilize hardware acceleration through NVIDIA's standard Geforce
graphics cards. In order for this project to utilize the hardware acceleration
it will need to be written in the CUDA/C++ langauge and compiled by NVIDIA's 
CUDA compiler. This aformentioned description applies to the core of the application
which raytraces a shadow across a three-dimensional object model. There will also be
an additional application that will display the effects of the lighting render, but
it will not utilize the performance-enhancing CUDA system. This display application
could be written difficultly using OpenGL, could be produced using GameMaker: Studio 
rather easily, or could be skipped since there are other applications available to
display 3D models. It has not been decided yet at this moment how we wish to proceed
with a display application since it depends on the unknown quantity of work that we
will be getting ourselves into.

It makes sense to do this type of rendering with a GPU considering how many repetitive
calculations are made in raytracing. Currently many 3D modeling environments perform
ray-traces to "bake" lighting to models using the CPU. For very high-detail models this
operation can take several minutes.
<br /><br />
We plan to use NDSU's Titan machine to do our renderings.
